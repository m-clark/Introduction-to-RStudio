## 

<div style='text-align: center; font-size:32'><h1>Interactive and Visual Data Exploration<h1></div>


## The Viewer

Along with the <span class="emph">Plots</span> pane, RStudio provides a <span class="emph">Viewer</span> pane.

Anything interactive will be displayed there.


## Packages

<span class="pack">ggplot2</span> is the most widely used package for visualization in R.

However, it does not produce interactive plots by nature.

Many packages use various Javascript libraries to provide interactive graphics.

<div class="col2">
  - <span class="pack">d3</span>
  - <span class="pack">leaflet</span>
  - <span class="pack">vis</span>
  - <span class="pack">mermaid</span>
<img src="../img/jslogo.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">
</div>
Many utilize these packages via the <span class="pack">htmlwidgets</span> R package.


## Packages

Some packages to note:

  - <span class="pack">plotly</span>
    - used also in Python, Matlab, Julia, aside from many interactive plots, can convert ggplot2 images to interactive ones.

  - <span class="pack">ggvis</span>
    - interactive successor to to ggplot though not currently actively developed

  - <span class="pack">rbokeh</span>
    - like plotly, also has cross program support

  - <span class="pack">DT</span>
    - interactive data tables


## Example

Works in your presentations too.

```{r}
library(plotly)
df <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2011_february_us_airport_traffic.csv')
df$pop = maps::us.cities$pop[match(paste(df$city, df$state), maps::us.cities$name)]
df$hover <- with(df, paste(airport, city, '<br>',
                           "Population: ", pop, '<br>', 
                           "Arrivals: ", cnt))

# marker styling
m <- list(
  colorbar = list(title = "Incoming flights February 2011"),
  size = scales::rescale(df$pop, c(5, 20)), opacity = 0.5, border='rgba(0,0,0,0)'
)

# geo styling
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  showland = TRUE,
  landcolor = toRGB("gray95"),
  subunitcolor = toRGB("gray85"),
  countrycolor = toRGB("gray85"),
  countrywidth = 0.5,
  subunitwidth = 0.5,
  bgcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)'
)

plot_ly(df, lat = ~lat, lon = ~long, text = ~hover, color = ~cnt, marker=m, 
        type = 'scattergeo', locationmode = 'USA-states', mode = 'markers', colors='RdBu',
         width=1000) %>%
  layout(title = 'Most trafficked US airports<br>(Hover for airport)', geo = g,
         paper_bgcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)',
         plot_bgcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)',
         font=list(color=toRGB("gray85"))
         )
```


## Shiny

<span class="emph">Shiny</span> is a framework that can essentially allow you to build an interactive website.

- Provided by RStudio developers

Most of the more recently developed visualization packages will work specifically within the shiny and rmarkdown settings.




## Interactive and Visual Data Exploration


RStudio lets you take a deeper look at your data more easily.

Accessible interactivity.

Interactive graphics are more fun too!

Just a couple visualization packages can go a very long way.
