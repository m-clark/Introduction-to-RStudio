## Addins

One can create functions that can be used within RStudio with a click or keystroke.

These special functions are called <span class="emph">*addins*</span>.

Increase your productivity and efficiency when scripting.

They can be *anything*.

- One of the more useful is text insertion/formatting.
- Saves a lot of time in document creation


## Creating Addins

Addins are in some sense nothing more than R functions that you can call interactively.

```{r}
likeR = function() {
  rstudioapi::insertText("I like R!")
}
```

```
likeR()
I like R!
```

However, they can possibly do quite a bit.

## Example: ColorPicker

<img src="../img/colorpicker.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width: 75%">


## Example: Radiant

<img src="../img/addin_radiant.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width: 75%">
